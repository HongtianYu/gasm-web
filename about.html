            <abbr>GASM</abbr> stands for the Graphic Assembly Language - its goal is to 
            assist you in making complex patterns or other contents with modern graphics
            and computing power.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you need GASM?</h3>
        <p style="line-height: 1.75em;">
            Well, imagine drawing a perfect regular hexagon with
            <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint">MS Paint</a>,
            or a sine wave with the pencil tool, or even randomly generating graphics 
            which couldn't even be achieved with most of the modern popular tools.
            But now you could access an extremely powerful tool: GASM. It's easy, and
            it's <b>programmable</b>&excl; You could write your own algorithm to generate graphics
            as complex as you wish while maintaining its accuracy with its mathematical
            nature and its linear vector representation in its core. You could even extend
            it with your own features &ndash; simply fork the source code of the playground 
            or the console page (both accessible through the menu&nbsp;bar 
            at the top of this page)&excl;
